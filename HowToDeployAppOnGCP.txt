On GCP
    1. Create new project

Point 1. create app.yaml file in local with
runtime: python
env: flex                                                 ## flexible env
entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT main:application           ## -b=binding with port no.

runtime_config:
  python_version: 3

manual_scaling:
  instances: 1                                             ##
resources:
  cpu: 1
  memory_gb: 0.5
  disk_size_gb: 10

Point 1. Your main python file name should be application.py
Point 2. Your flask object name, which we have defined in application.py should also be the application.
Point 3. .ebignore  is responsible to hold the name of those files which we don't want to push on a cloud.
Point 4. Create a requirements.txt file.
        Command : pip freeze > requirements.txt
Point 5. Create a folder called .ebextensions
Point 6. Inside .ebextensions we need a python.config file.
Point 7. Mention the commands in python.config
            option_settings:
              "aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python":
                WSGIPath: application:application

Create .zip file with
    1. .ebextensions
    2. .git
    3. static
    4. templates
    5. .ebignore
    6. application.py
    7. finalized_model.pickle
    8. requirements.txt

In Elastic Beamstick
Step 1:
    Create applicaion-->select platform as python-->upload file(.zip file which is created above )--> click on create application--> Check status & logs
